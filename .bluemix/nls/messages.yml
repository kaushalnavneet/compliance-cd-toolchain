template.description: "This is the toolchain template for continuous deployment with Compliance for Kubernetes. It is preconfigured for continuous delivery with inventory integration, change management with Servicenow, evidence collection and deployment to the IBM Kubernetes Service.\n\n The integrated repositories, target cluster and artifactory integrations are configured during the setup process. \n\nThe toolchain includes a Tekton delivery pipeline, which can be manually triggered to initiate a new deployment. \n\nThe toolchain can use a Key-Protect vault instance to store the required tokens and API keys."
